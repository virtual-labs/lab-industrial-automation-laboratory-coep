The geographical and functional distribution makes this tool 'promising' for the implementation of advanced control strategies. Many industries are using this control system to fully automate their plants.</br></br>The complex controls demand a different kind of thought process to implement automation philosophies. This laboratory gives students insight into "function block diagram (FBD)" level programming.
Most remote-triggered labs are using this technique extensively.
